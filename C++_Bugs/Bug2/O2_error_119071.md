This test case triggers compiler error when run with -O2 optimization. For details please refer https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=119071.
Bug 2 is not replicable at all since it focuses on compiler flags in C++. The problem is there are not equivalent compiler flags in Python, Java, C#, Rust that we know of. This is an issue that will require more work and extra research. We assume that these optimization errors are specific to GCC and do not occur in other compilers.
