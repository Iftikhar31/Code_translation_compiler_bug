https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/130809

C# translator does not understand stackFrame

C++ translator does not translate the problem correctly

Java translator does not translate the problem correctly

Rust translator does not translate the problem correctly

### Order of conditionals not correct after compilation 
https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/122821

Lots of effort to test. Is it worth it? 

### TRACEBACK
https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/118978

Should display traceback rather than just overflow. 

C# broken, only says stack overflow 

C++ broken, only says timeout 

Java works

Rust recursion is not supported
